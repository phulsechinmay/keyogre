# KeyOgre Development Log

## Milestone 1 - Live-Key Overlay Implementation

### 2025-06-15 - Project Setup
- Created basic Xcode project structure for KeyOgre
- Implemented core components:
  - `KeyOgreApp.swift` - Main app entry point with global hotkey (⌃⌥K)
  - `KeyEventTap.swift` - CGEventTap wrapper with Combine publishers
  - `KeyboardLayout.swift` - ANSI 60% keyboard model with proper positioning
  - `KeyboardView.swift` - SwiftUI renderer with pastel theme and animations
  - `LastTenView.swift` - Rolling character buffer display
  - `ColorTheme.swift` - Muted pastel color definitions matching reference video

### Technical Implementation Notes
- Used protocol-based design for KeyEventTap to enable testing with mock objects
- Implemented 1.05x scale + glow effect for key highlighting (~150ms duration)
- ANSI 60% layout with 61 keys properly positioned and sized
- Character buffer maintains last 10 keystrokes with smooth animations
- Accessibility permission handling with user-friendly prompts

### Testing Strategy
- Created unit tests for KeyEventTap with synthetic key injection
- KeyboardLayout tests verify positioning, legends, and structure
- Mock implementation allows testing without actual event monitoring
- Coverage includes buffer management, key lookup, and layout validation

### Next Steps for M1
1. Fix any compilation issues in Xcode
2. Test accessibility permissions flow
3. Verify visual appearance matches reference video
4. Add snapshot tests for key highlighting
5. Ensure global hotkey toggle works properly

### 2025-06-15 20:42 - Enhanced Testing & Visual Improvements
- **Enhanced Key Structure**: Updated Key struct to support dual labels (base + shift symbols) and individual key colors
- **ANSI60KeyboardLayout**: Created dedicated layout class matching reference screenshot:
  - Column-based color scheme with muted pastels (green, yellow, orange, gray, pink)
  - Dual-label keys showing shift symbols on top, base symbols on bottom
  - Proper key positioning with tighter spacing (2px vs 4px) and smaller corner radius (2px)
- **Comprehensive Unit Tests**: Added full test suite with 3 test files:
  - `ANSI60KeyboardLayoutTests.swift` - Layout structure, key distribution, color validation
  - `KeyEventTapTests.swift` - Publisher behavior, monitoring lifecycle, protocol conformance
  - `KeyStructTests.swift` - Key initialization, dual labels, equality, frame properties
- **Visual Polish**: Updated keyboard rendering to match screenshot with smaller corner radius and tighter key grouping
- **Swift 6 Compatibility**: Fixed protocol references and type checking for modern Swift

### Future Milestones Planning
- M2: Typing practice with accuracy tracking and WPM calculation
- M3: UX polish with slide animations and theme selection
- M4: Custom ZMK layout parsing and storage
- M5: Distribution with hardened runtime and notarization
