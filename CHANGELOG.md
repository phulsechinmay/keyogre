# KeyOgre Development Log

## Milestone 1 - Live-Key Overlay Implementation

### 2025-06-15 - Project Setup
- Created basic Xcode project structure for KeyOgre
- Implemented core components:
  - `KeyOgreApp.swift` - Main app entry point with global hotkey (⌃⌥K)
  - `KeyEventTap.swift` - CGEventTap wrapper with Combine publishers
  - `KeyboardLayout.swift` - ANSI 60% keyboard model with proper positioning
  - `KeyboardView.swift` - SwiftUI renderer with pastel theme and animations
  - `LastTenView.swift` - Rolling character buffer display
  - `ColorTheme.swift` - Muted pastel color definitions matching reference video

### Technical Implementation Notes
- Used protocol-based design for KeyEventTap to enable testing with mock objects
- Implemented 1.05x scale + glow effect for key highlighting (~150ms duration)
- ANSI 60% layout with 61 keys properly positioned and sized
- Character buffer maintains last 10 keystrokes with smooth animations
- Accessibility permission handling with user-friendly prompts

### Testing Strategy
- Created unit tests for KeyEventTap with synthetic key injection
- KeyboardLayout tests verify positioning, legends, and structure
- Mock implementation allows testing without actual event monitoring
- Coverage includes buffer management, key lookup, and layout validation

### Next Steps for M1
1. Fix any compilation issues in Xcode
2. Test accessibility permissions flow
3. Verify visual appearance matches reference video
4. Add snapshot tests for key highlighting
5. Ensure global hotkey toggle works properly

### Future Milestones Planning
- M2: Typing practice with accuracy tracking and WPM calculation
- M3: UX polish with slide animations and theme selection
- M4: Custom ZMK layout parsing and storage
- M5: Distribution with hardened runtime and notarization
